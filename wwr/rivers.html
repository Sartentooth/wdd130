                    Nestled deep in the Frank Church Wilderness of No Return winds the
                    Salmon river. The Salmon was given the nickname long ago as the
                    River of No Return by the people living near it because of the
                    number of folks that came to visit and fell so in love with the
                    rugged beauty of the river that they never left.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    Herds of elk and deer graze on the hillsides around the river and
                    bear and bighorn sheep are also commonly sighted. The river corridor
                    is also lined with awe inspiring ponderosa pine which tower over the
                    sandy beaches in the campsites and provide shelter from sun or rain
                    when needed.

                    <p>
                    Let's not forget the rapids! They range from class I-IV. The Salmon
                    is one of the longest undammed rivers in the United States. As a
                    free flowing river the water is higher, faster, and colder in the
                    early summer and lower, slower, and warmer in the late summer. There
                    are good rapids all summer...but families with children who like to
                    swim tend to appreciate the late summer's slower, warmer water more.

                    Winding through canyons in central Utah, in some of the most
                    desolate land anywhere, the Green river flows towards the mighty
                    Colorado river and the sea. High grey stone cliffs, beautiful desert
                    scenery, and great rapids have made this run famous. This 84-mile
                    trip runs from from Sand Wash to Swaseys Rapid (just outside Green
                    River Utah) and boasts outstanding scenery, interesting geologic
                    formations, evidence of prehistoric and historic human activity, and
                    great whitewater opportunities.

                    Desolation is rated a Class II/III and is usually done in 6 days

                    Desolation Canyon has been recognized as a National Landmark.  This
                    designation is based on the uniqueness and rich history that the
                    canyon tells.

                    This is the grand daddy of all canyons and the grand daddy of all
                    river trips. You will never forget your visit to the Grand Canyon.

                    Grand Canyon river rafting combines world-class whitewater with
                    breathtaking scenery to make one truly unforgettable river
                    experience. The canyon is filled not only with exhilarating
                    whitewater rapids, but with side canyons and ancient indian ruins
                    accessible only by river.

                    CLASS I - X: The Grand Canyon uses a unique river rating scale. The
                    rapids in the Canyon are technically rated I - X ( 1 - 10) to
                    accommodate such a wide variety of rapids and river variances.
                    However, most people are familiar with the regular I - V river
                    rating scale, so we often refer to both.
