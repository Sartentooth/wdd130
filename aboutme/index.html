    <h2>Sebas</h2>
    <p><pre>Hi guys, Hello there! I'm Sebastian but you can call me Sebas. I from from Buenos Aires, Argentina.
I'm married 17 years ago and we have to kid. Currently, I serve in the church as a Bishop since march 2021
and it's a beautifull experience and opportunity to serve others.</pre></p>
    <p><pre>In the past, I studied Game Design and some languages of programming like C# and JavaScript.
I'm not a master's in this area but I have a little knowledge and I'm so excited to learn more about web and 
computer programming. The last semester I finished Pathway Connect too, and actually, I'm not a good speaker of
English but I get more practice.</pre></p>
